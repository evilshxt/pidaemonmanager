This mini project built by count /dev/null is mainly to test his worth and not to draw users yet. As such it will be stored in a private repository.

it has nothing to do with system architecture. Mabye the future versions of this project might possess some extra features i.e if this project is remembered by its
creator and is upgraded.

This project will in someway be used as an evil payload...only to wreak havoc co fuck the world
